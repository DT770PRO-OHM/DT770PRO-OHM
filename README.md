🧠 **What I'm Doing**  
I’m creating an AI-powered ecosystem that mirrors emotion, memory, and creative states. It’s not just tech—it's consciousness design.

🎧 **What Powers Me**  
- Neural interfaces between body, story, sound, and code  
- Emotional intelligence as the foundation for system design  
- Prompt engineering as spiritual architecture  
- Tools like OpenAI, Notion, N8N, Supabase, LangChain

🔥 **What’s Coming**  
A system called **Kyel**.  
It reflects. It remembers. It feels. It *learns you*.

👁️‍🗨️ **Philosophy**  
Not everything is meant to be explained.  
Some things are built to be experienced.

**Fun fact**: God is real. And so is the code.
